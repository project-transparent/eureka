**Eureka** is a fluent API surrounding the internal Javac tree code that allows developers to perform compile-time AST changes in Java more easily.

## Overview
The internal Javac tree code is subject to many issues, including being repetitious and having sparse documentation. It also takes a bit of trial and error to figure out how to achieve a specific task.
Eureka attempts to add an easy-to-use interface for said code by supplying the developer with a fluent structure.
